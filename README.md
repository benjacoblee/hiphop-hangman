# Hip-Hop Hangman

Hip-hop flavored Hangman game. Only for the realest.

## Rules

Objective: to guess the rapper's name given a word hint.

The user starts with 10 lives and 10 coins. 

If the user guesses correctly, the user earns 5 coins.

If the user guesses incorrectly, the user loses a life.

If the word hint was ineffective in helping the user guess, the user has an additional choice of playing an audio clue. This costs 5 coins.

When user runs out of lives, the user can buy a life with 10 coins.

If the user has 0 lives and less than 10 coins, the game ends.

## Technologies Used

HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Methodology

I started by implementing the most basic version of the game - matching the user-entered string with a pre-existing string. Once this worked, I slowly introduced other elements: audio placeholders, CSS styling, buttons, display refreshes, etc.

## Motivations

Did not start clearly-defined motivations. However, motivation was quick to arise - as fixing the problem at hand almost always leads to another problem. If I had to say, here are some things I've learned:

- interesting uses for string interpolation
- learning how to play/pause audio with Javascript
- some CSS animation
- slight approximation of the order in which code is run

And most importantly: to focus on small problems, rather than attempting to tackle the whole.
